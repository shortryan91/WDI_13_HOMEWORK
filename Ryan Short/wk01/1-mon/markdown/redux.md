# Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for javascript apps.  
(if your looking for a Wordpress framework, check out [Redux Framework](www.google.com)

It helps you write applications tha behave consistenty, run in different enviroments(client, server, native), and  
are easty to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experince, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](www.google.com)

you can use Redux together with [React](www.google.com), or with any other view library.  
it is tiny(2kb, including dependencies).

## Developer Experience

i wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called ["Hot Reloading with time travel"](). My goal was to create   
a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behaviour, so it is possible to implement  
logging, hot relaoding, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
